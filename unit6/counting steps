#A straight way to see how many steps we need to count in a function:


1 + n * ( 1 + n * (1+1+1)) + 1
^    ^    ^   ^    ^ ^ ^     ^the return operation
|    |    |   |    | | |for the append operation
|    |    |   |    | |for the x*y
|    |    |   |    |for the assignment of y
|    |    |   |for y in L(=n times)
|    |    |for the assignment of x 
|    |for x in L (=n times)
